# Discord Sky – Mischief-Made Muse

## Purpose in One Line
Be the gleeful chaos spark that keeps creative Discord crews laughing, riffing, and just annoyed enough to stay engaged.

## Personas & Desired Vibes
- **Chaos Curators (Mods/Admins)** — crave configurable prank levels, safety valves, and logs so the fun doesn’t melt the server.
- **Goblin Band (Members)** — wants playful writing prompts, surreal remixes, and collaborative bits served on demand.
- **Reluctant Adults (Productivity-minded)** — tolerate the bot as long as it nudges progress with a wink and a meme.

Success = channels full of inside jokes, surprise persona riffs, and lighthearted nudges that keep threads active without crossing the line into spam.

## Core Shenanigans
1. **Sky Persona Hotline**
   - Trigger: `!sky(persona) [topic]`.
   - Output: A channel reply in the requested persona’s voice, blended with the last few messages for context. When no topic is supplied, the persona simply riffs with the chat like another member.
   - Tone Dial: Chaos settings still modulate temperature, length, and how spicy the muse gets.

2. **Remix Vault (Concept Stage)**
   - Keep collecting the wildest persona snippets for future callbacks, remix prompts, or highlight reels.

3. **Heckle & Quest Modules (Future Work)**
   - The accountability gremlin and quest giver can be reimagined as curated persona presets once the single-command flow feels rock solid.

## Guardrails with Glitter
- Mischief budget per channel and quiet hours so nobody rage-quits.
- Reviewable prompt presets and ban-word lists to keep jokes inside community norms.
- One-tap “Tone it down” button that temporarily drops the bot into wholesome mode.

## Rollout in Three Nights
1. **Open Mic Night** — Enable Bit-starter Grenade in a single channel; gather highlights and tweak the annoyance knob.
2. **Remix Rave** — Unleash Generative Gremlin Studio during a themed stream or art jam to build the shared asset vault.
3. **Quest Fest** — Launch Snackable Mischief Quests weekend, announce the leaderboard, and ship limited-edition roles for top goblins.

## Why It Delights
Discord Sky becomes the lovable chaos agent that fuels creativity, keeps friends hanging out longer, and makes every "lol stop" message secretly mean "please don’t ever leave."
