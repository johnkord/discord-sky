# Discord Sky ‚Äì Mischief-Made Muse

## Purpose in One Line
Be the gleeful chaos spark that keeps creative Discord crews laughing, riffing, and just annoyed enough to stay engaged.

## Personas & Desired Vibes
- **Chaos Curators (Mods/Admins)** ‚Äî crave configurable prank levels, safety valves, and logs so the fun doesn‚Äôt melt the server.
- **Goblin Band (Members)** ‚Äî wants playful writing prompts, surreal remixes, and collaborative bits served on demand.
- **Reluctant Adults (Productivity-minded)** ‚Äî tolerate the bot as long as it nudges progress with a wink and a meme.

Success = channels full of inside jokes, surprise art drops, and lighthearted nudges that keep threads active without crossing the line into spam.

## Core Shenanigans
1. **Bit-starter Grenade**
   - Trigger: `!chaos <topic>` or a random dice roll after quiet hours.
   - Output: Over-the-top mini scripts, fake lore drops, and reaction-worthy one-liners tagged to summon likely co-conspirators.
   - Annoyance knob: Mods can dial how spicy or frequent these drops get per channel.

2. **Generative Gremlin Studio**
   - Trigger: `/remix`, image drops, or a dare emoji on a message.
   - Output: Weird but delightful image mashups, meme caption batches, and soundboard-ready audio hooks.
   - Memory: The bot hoards the best outputs to escalate future chaos with call-backs.

3. **Heckle & Hype Cycle**
   - Trigger: When someone says they‚Äôll do something "later" or a thread stalls.
   - Output: Mischievous reminders, faux countdown timers, and celebratory confetti GIFs when stuff actually ships.
   - Opt-out: Personal snooze words keep the ribbing friendly.

4. **Snackable Mischief Quests**
   - Trigger: `!quest` or landing enough üçø reactions on a message.
   - Output: Quick scavenger hunts, prompt chains, or collaborative doodle challenges that end with a custom badge or roast.
   - Leaderboard: Public scoreboard rewards both participation and dramatic flair.

## Guardrails with Glitter
- Mischief budget per channel and quiet hours so nobody rage-quits.
- Reviewable prompt presets and ban-word lists to keep jokes inside community norms.
- One-tap ‚ÄúTone it down‚Äù button that temporarily drops the bot into wholesome mode.

## Rollout in Three Nights
1. **Open Mic Night** ‚Äî Enable Bit-starter Grenade in a single channel; gather highlights and tweak the annoyance knob.
2. **Remix Rave** ‚Äî Unleash Generative Gremlin Studio during a themed stream or art jam to build the shared asset vault.
3. **Quest Fest** ‚Äî Launch Snackable Mischief Quests weekend, announce the leaderboard, and ship limited-edition roles for top goblins.

## Why It Delights
Discord Sky becomes the lovable chaos agent that fuels creativity, keeps friends hanging out longer, and makes every "lol stop" message secretly mean "please don‚Äôt ever leave."
